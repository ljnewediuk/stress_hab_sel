# Life history trade-offs in glucocorticoid-mediated habitat selection

This repository is a supplement to the paper, _Life history trade-offs in glucocorticoid-mediated habitat selection_. Data (excluding spatial locations) are in `derived_data`. R scripts are organized in `R_scripts` and `R_functions`. Dependencies: `tidyverse`, `sf`, `uhc_plots`, `raster`, `amt`, `glmmTMB`.

The cort-adaptation and cort-fitness hypotheses both propose glucocorticoids produced by parents mediate trade-offs between their own survival and that of their offspring. The contribution of glucocorticoids to offspring provisioning can quantify these trade-offs because provisioning poses a risk to parents. However, attributing provisioning behaviour to glucocorticoids is difficult because glucocorticoids often drive foraging behaviours to store energy for later provisioning. We compared the effects of glucocorticoids on habitat selection before and after calving to test for the trade-offs female elk make when provisioning offspring. Despite finding that female elk with elevated glucocorticoids selected more strongly for high-risk, high-forage cropland, we found no difference in glucocorticoid production nor a significant change in the effect of glucocorticoids on cropland selection at calving time when lactating elk required the more energy. However, we found a gradual increase in the effect of glucocorticoids on cropland selection by female elk as their calves grew, suggesting the growing energy requirements of calves encouraged more risky habitat selection behaviours by their parents over time. We suggest trade-offs in investment between parents and offspring across life history stages can be tested by integrating glucocorticoids into habitat selection models. Ultimately, this integration will help elucidate the adaptive function of glucocorticoids.
